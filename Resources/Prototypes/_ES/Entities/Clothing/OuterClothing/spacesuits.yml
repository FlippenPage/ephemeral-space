# ============================== DESIGN NOTE ====================================
# Spacesuits for sec/command intentionally do not have any form of armor on them.
# This is to make spaced areas a generally disadvantageous position for all players
# sec/command already retain the upper hand in terms of access, armor, supplies, etc.
# in most situations, so stripping armor when in space levels the playing field for
# players trying to take them down.
